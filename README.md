# python-keepasshttp
Access passwords stored in keepass using the http plugin 

Until a library is actually put together, see [Keepass Protocol](https://github.com/jobevers/python-keepasshttp/blob/master/Keepass%20Protocol.ipynb) for reference.

The jupyter notebook is based based off of the keepasshttp author's [Protocol Summary](https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp#protocol)
and the [Javascript Client Implementation](https://github.com/pfn/passifox/blob/master/chromeipass/background/keepass.js)
